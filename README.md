# NeXtMD
NeXtMD is a novel dual-module stacked framework that integrates both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) components for accurate AIP identification.

Schematic illustration of the NeXtMD framework. (A) Overview of the NeXtMD architecture, which comprises four main components: feature extraction, initial prediction using machine learning classifiers, feature refinement via a multi-layer grouped residual network, and final classification. (B) Representation of the first module, including feature fusion and predictions generated by four distinct machine learning classifiers (RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, and GBDT). (C) Structure of ResNeXt module, consisting of five sequential layers with multiple residual blocks, followed by the terminal classification layer.

# NeXtMD
NeXtMD is a novel dual-module stacked framework that integrates both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) components for accurate AIP identification.

## Structure

Schematic illustration of the NeXtMD framework. (A) Overview of the NeXtMD architecture, which comprises four main components: feature extraction, initial prediction using machine learning classifiers, feature refinement via a multi-layer grouped residual network, and final classification. (B) Representation of the first module, including feature fusion and predictions generated by four distinct machine learning classifiers (RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, and GBDT). (C) Structure of ResNeXt module, consisting of five sequential layers with multiple residual blocks, followed by the terminal classification layer.

## Datasets
AIP.txt is the main AIP dataset for training and testing NeXtMD.
AIP_train_set_converted.fasta and AIP_test_set_converted.fasta comes from AIP.txt
AMP.txt is the AMP dataset for testing NeXtMD's transferability across peptide tasks.
The other .txt are external testing datasets.

## Codes
NeXtMD_final.py is the model codes of NeXtMD from read data, feature extraction, training to model testing.
Amino_acid_attribution_score.py is using for AIP datasets' amino acid analysis.
Sequence_length_detection.py is using for AIP datasets' sequence length analysis.
Characteristic_ablation.py & MLmodel _ablation.py are using for NeXtMD's ablation testing.
